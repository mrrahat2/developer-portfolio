                <h3>Establish career expectations</h3>
                <p>Software developers can decide on a direction and establish where to take their career by setting goals. These goals can be different areas of their career or they can progress toward a specific end goal. Accomplishing goals can help developers create a career that aligns with what they want. They can set expectations and use goals as individual steps to help them achieve those expectations. Taking the time to consider and plan their goals can help them decide what to accomplish and how.</p>
